I pray for Your Spirit to powerfully incline my heart to your testimonies, and not to selfish gain! (Psalm 119:36). Help me to value Your truth above all selfish gain. Turn my eyes from looking at worthless things; and give me life in your ways (Psalm 119:37). Empower me to find true life and joy in Your ways. 
 I pray that You would open my eyes, that I may behold wondrous things out of your law (Psalm 119:18). Remove any veil from my heart and mind that prevents me from truly beholding the wondrous things in Your law. Grant me spiritual insight to grasp the depth of Your truth, that I may be amazed and transformed by Your Word. 
 O LORD, I desire to walk in Your truth. Teach me your way, O LORD, that I may walk in your truth; unite my heart to fear your name (Psalm 86:11). Purify my motives and my affections so that my entire being is singularly devoted to fearing Your holy name. May there be no division in my loyalty, but a wholehearted commitment to You alone. 
 Gracious God, I pray that You would satisfy us in the morning with your steadfast love, that we may rejoice and be glad all our days (Psalm 90:14). Let Your love be the deep well from which I draw all my contentment and joy. May this satisfaction in You empower me to rejoice and be glad in You all my days, regardless of my circumstances.">IOUS</option><option value='Lord, we lift up our local leaders and institutions to You. We pray for the local media—that they would report truthfully, fairly, and with integrity. For City Managers, Mayors, and Council Members, give them wisdom and a heart to serve their communities with justice and compassion. We pray for our law enforcement—for Police, Sheriffs, and Deputies—grant them courage, protection, and integrity in every decision. For the local courts throughout the tri-state cities, towns, and villages, may justice be upheld with impartiality and discernment. We lift up the County Governments of Hamilton, Clermont, Boone, Kenton, Campbell, Dearborn, and Ohio counties—guide them in truth, humility, and wise stewardship. As Daniel 2:20–22 declares: "Blessed be the name of God forever and ever, to whom belong wisdom and might.

As Matthew 6:33 says, "But seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness, and all these things will be added to you."'>Skills</option><option value='Lord, we lift up the leaders of our states to You.

For all state legislators, we ask for discernment, courage, and a heart to uphold justice and truth. We lift up the State Courts—may their rulings reflect righteousness and impartiality. For the State Militias and all Law Enforcement personnel, we ask for strength, protection, and accountability in their service.

Give them wisdom and courage as they share their faith. Please ensure the safe delivery of Bibles into their hands. We ask You to powerfully work through media ministries that are broadcasting Your Word across closed borders. Let these messages reach hearts and bear lasting fruit. Strengthen and protect persecuted Christians, especially those imprisoned for their faith. Surround them with Your presence and sustain their hope. Stir the hearts of believers in free nations. Help them to embrace their faith deeply and actively support their persecuted brothers and sisters with prayer, advocacy, and generosity. We pray for the transformation of government officials in hostile nations. Soften their hearts and guide them toward truth, justice, and mercy. Bless and uphold pastoral leaders working in difficult and dangerous places. Give them endurance, joy, and the resources they need. And finally, Lord, we pray for the Pashtun peoples. Open their hearts to Your truth and raise up laborers to share the Good News with them.">World Situation</option></select><div id=selectedPrayer class=selectedPrayer>Select a Prayer Category</div><div class=todaysRequests><h3>Today's Request</h3><strong>Community Group</strong>:<br>Andrew Omerzu, Brad and Molly Turner, Hayden and Emmalynn Sphire, Jake and Bri Rose, Joey and Sarah Koo, Clay and Natalie Winslow, Cody and Kat Pelle, Kyle Soiste, Mike and Charissa Napoles.<br><br><strong>Coworkers</strong>:<br>Lord, may I and we be a force multiplier for the gospel, our employers, and our colleagues—Joe, Hollis, Brent, Rob, John F., Samri, Ron, Jason, Wenye, David G., Michael, Russ, Jake, Tom, Karen, Brad B., Jereon, Pei—and other related teams and IT groups at W&S.

For the Judicial Branch, we ask that judges at every level, especially the Supreme Court, would uphold justice with humility, impartiality, and fear of You. We also pray for special interest groups and the national media—that they would act with honesty, fairness, and a sincere desire to inform and not to manipulate. As Proverbs 21:1 says, "The king's heart is a stream of water in the hand of the LORD; he turns it wherever he will." May You guide their hearts according to Your perfect will.<br><br></div><br><div class=bg-EmailTODOs><h3><a href="mailto:mark.mcfadden@wslife.com?subject=TODOs"><strong>Email TODO's</strong></a></h3></div><br><div class=bg-TodaysCatechsim><h3><a href=https://todaysreading.github.io/vov/34.html target=_blank>Today's Valley of Vision Prayer</a></h3></div><br><div class=bg-TodaysPsalm><h3>Today's Psalm</h3><strong>Psalm 132</strong>: A Song of Ascents.
[1] Remember, O LORD, in David’s favor,
all the hardships he endured,
[2] how he swore to the LORD
and vowed to the Mighty One of Jacob,
[3] “I will not enter my house
or get into my bed,
[4] I will not give sleep to my eyes
or slumber to my eyelids,
[5] until I find a place for the LORD,
a dwelling place for the Mighty One of Jacob.”
[6] Behold, we heard of it in Ephrathah;
we found it in the fields of Jaar.
[7] “Let us go to his dwelling place;
let us worship at his footstool!”
[8] Arise, O LORD, and go to your resting place,
you and the ark of your might.
[9] Let your priests be clothed with righteousness,
and let your saints shout for joy.
[10] For the sake of your servant David,
do not turn away the face of your anointed one.
[11] The LORD swore to David a sure oath
from which he will not turn back:
“One of the sons of your body
I will set on your throne.
[12] If your sons keep my covenant
and my testimonies that I shall teach them,
their sons also forever
shall sit on your throne.”
[13] For the LORD has chosen Zion;
he has desired it for his dwelling place:
[14] “This is my resting place forever;
here I will dwell, for I have desired it.
[15] I will abundantly bless her provisions;
I will satisfy her poor with bread.
[16] Her priests I will clothe with salvation,
and her saints will shout for joy.
[17] There I will make a horn to sprout for David;
I have prepared a lamp for my anointed.
[18] His enemies I will clothe with shame,
but on him his crown will shine.”</div><script>function showSelectedPrayer(e){e!="Select Prayer Category"?$("#selectedPrayer").text(e):$("#selectedPrayer").text("Select a Prayer Category")}Number.prototype.toHHMMSS=function(){var s=parseInt(this,10),e=Math.floor(s/3600),t=Math.floor((s-e*3600)/60),n=s-e*3600-t*60;return e<10&&(e=""+e),t<10&&(t=""+t),n<10&&(n="0"+n),e>0?e+":"+t+":"+n:t+":"+n};var timer=0;function showCount(){timer--,timer>=0&&(document.getElementById("prayerTimer").innerHTML="Time to Pray: "+timer.toHHMMSS(),setTimeout(showCount,1e3))}function startTimer(){var e=document.querySelector('input[name="minutesToPray"]:checked').value;timer=60*e,showCount()}function clearTimer(){timer=0,document.getElementById("prayerTimer").innerHTML="Prayer Time (Minutes)";for(var t=document.getElementsByName("minutesToPray"),e=0;e<t.length;e++)t[e].checked=!1}</script></div></article></div></div></main><footer id=footer class=footer><div class=icon-links><a href=https://todaysprivateprayer.github.io/index.xml rel="noopener alternate" type=application/rss+xml class=iconfont title=rss target=_blank><svg class="icon" viewBox="0 0 1024 1024" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" width="30" height="30"><path d="M819.157333 1024C819.157333 574.592 449.408 204.8.0 204.8V0c561.706667.0 1024 462.293333 1024 1024H819.157333zM140.416 743.04a140.8 140.8.0 01140.501333 140.586667A140.928 140.928.0 01140.074667 1024C62.72 1024 0 961.109333.0 883.626667S62.933333 743.082667 140.416 743.04zM678.784 1024h-199.04c0-263.210667-216.533333-479.786667-479.744-479.786667v-199.04c372.352.0 678.784 306.517333 678.784 678.826667z"/></svg></a></div><div class=copyright><span class=power-by>Powered by <a class=hexo-link href=https://gohugo.io>Hugo</a>
