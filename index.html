Help us create a psychologically safe learning environment for all.

For the Judicial Branch, we ask that judges at every level, especially the Supreme Court, would uphold justice with humility, impartiality, and fear of You. We also pray for special interest groups and the national media—that they would act with honesty, fairness, and a sincere desire to inform and not to manipulate.

 I pray that You would open my eyes, that I may behold wondrous things out of your law (Psalm 119:18). Remove any veil from my heart and mind that prevents me from truly beholding the wondrous things in Your law. Grant me spiritual insight to grasp the depth of Your truth, that I may be amazed and transformed by Your Word. 
 O LORD, I desire to walk in Your truth. Teach me your way, O LORD, that I may walk in your truth; unite my heart to fear your name (Psalm 86:11). Purify my motives and my affections so that my entire being is singularly devoted to fearing Your holy name. May there be no division in my loyalty, but a wholehearted commitment to You alone. 
 Gracious God, I pray that You would satisfy us in the morning with your steadfast love, that we may rejoice and be glad all our days (Psalm 90:14).

For the local courts throughout the tri-state cities, towns, and villages, may justice be upheld with impartiality and discernment. We lift up the County Governments of Hamilton, Clermont, Boone, Kenton, Campbell, Dearborn, and Ohio counties—guide them in truth, humility, and wise stewardship. As Daniel 2:20–22 declares: "Blessed be the name of God forever and ever, to whom belong wisdom and might.

teach me your statutes!
[13] With my lips I declare
all the rules of your mouth.
[14] In the way of your testimonies I delight
as much as in all riches.
[15] I will meditate on your precepts
and fix my eyes on your ways.
[16] I will delight in your statutes;
I will not forget your word.
Gimel
[17] Deal bountifully with your servant,
that I may live and keep your word.

wondrous things out of your law.

for your rules at all times.

who wander from your commandments.

your servant will meditate on your statutes.
[24] Your testimonies are my delight;
they are my counselors.
Daleth

teach me your statutes!

and I will meditate on your wondrous works.
[28] My soul melts away for sorrow;
strengthen me according to your word!
[29] Put false ways far from me
and graciously teach me your law!

when you enlarge my heart!

which I love.

and I will meditate on your statutes.
Zayin
[49] Remember your word to your servant,
in which you have made me hope.

that your promise gives me life.

but I do not turn away from your law.
[52] When I think of your rules from of old,
I take comfort, O LORD.
[53] Hot indignation seizes me because of the wicked,
who forsake your law.

but now I keep your word.
[68] You are good and do good;
teach me your statutes.
[69] The insolent smear me with lies,
but with my whole heart I keep your precepts;
[70] their heart is unfeeling like fat,
but I delight in your law.
[71] It is good for me that I was afflicted,
that I might learn your statutes.
[72] The law of your mouth is better to me
than thousands of gold and silver pieces.

I ask, “When will you comfort me?”

yet I have not forgotten your statutes.
[84] How long must your servant endure?
When will you judge those who persecute me?

they do not live according to your law.

they persecute me with falsehood; help me!

that I may keep the testimonies of your mouth.
Lamedh

is firmly fixed in the heavens.

you have established the earth, and it stands fast.
[91] By your appointment they stand this day,
for all things are your servants.

for by them you have given me life.
[94] I am yours; save me,
for I have sought your precepts.

sweeter than honey to my mouth!
[104] Through your precepts I get understanding;

and a light to my path.
[106] I have sworn an oath and confirmed it,
to keep your righteous rules.

give me life, O LORD, according to your word!
[108] Accept my freewill offerings of praise, O LORD,
and teach me your rules.
[109] I hold my life in my hand continually,
but I do not forget your law.
[110] The wicked have laid a snare for me,
but I do not stray from your precepts.
[111] Your testimonies are my heritage forever,
for they are the joy of my heart.
[112] I incline my heart to perform your statutes
forever, to the end.

for their cunning is in vain.
[119] All the wicked of the earth you discard like dross,
therefore I love your testimonies.
[120] My flesh trembles for fear of you,
and I am afraid of your judgments.
Ayin
[121] I have done what is just and right;
do not leave me to my oppressors.

and for the fulfillment of your righteous promise.
[124] Deal with your servant according to your steadfast love,
and teach me your statutes.
[125] I am your servant; give me understanding,
that I may know your testimonies!
[126] It is time for the LORD to act,
for your law has been broken.

above gold, above fine gold.
[128] Therefore I consider all your precepts to be right;
I hate every false way.

and your servant loves it.

give me understanding that I may live.

I hope in your words.
[148] My eyes are awake before the watches of the night,
that I may meditate on your promise.

O LORD, according to your justice give me life.

that you have founded them forever.

like one who finds great spoil.
