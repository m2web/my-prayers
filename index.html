Teach us to give joyfully and generously. Lead us to take the gospel to new places—across the street and around the world.

Help us create a psychologically safe learning environment for all.

For the Executive Branch, we pray for the President, the Vice President, the Cabinet, and all federal agencies—grant them wisdom, integrity, and a deep sense of accountability before You. For the Legislative Branch, we pray for members of Congress in both the House and the Senate—give them clarity, courage, and a heart to serve the public good rather than personal or partisan gain. For the Judicial Branch, we ask that judges at every level, especially the Supreme Court, would uphold justice with humility, impartiality, and fear of You. We also pray for special interest groups and the national media—that they would act with honesty, fairness, and a sincere desire to inform and not to manipulate.

I pray for Your Spirit to powerfully incline my heart to your testimonies, and not to selfish gain! (Psalm 119:36). Help me to value Your truth above all selfish gain. Turn my eyes from looking at worthless things; and give me life in your ways (Psalm 119:37). Empower me to find true life and joy in Your ways. 
 I pray that You would open my eyes, that I may behold wondrous things out of your law (Psalm 119:18). Remove any veil from my heart and mind that prevents me from truly beholding the wondrous things in Your law. Grant me spiritual insight to grasp the depth of Your truth, that I may be amazed and transformed by Your Word. 
 O LORD, I desire to walk in Your truth. Teach me your way, O LORD, that I may walk in your truth; unite my heart to fear your name (Psalm 86:11). Purify my motives and my affections so that my entire being is singularly devoted to fearing Your holy name. May there be no division in my loyalty, but a wholehearted commitment to You alone. 
 Gracious God, I pray that You would satisfy us in the morning with your steadfast love, that we may rejoice and be glad all our days (Psalm 90:14). Let Your love be the deep well from which I draw all my contentment and joy. May this satisfaction in You empower me to rejoice and be glad in You all my days, regardless of my circumstances.">IOUS</option><option value='Lord, we lift up our local leaders and institutions to You. We pray for the local media—that they would report truthfully, fairly, and with integrity.

We pray for our law enforcement—for Police, Sheriffs, and Deputies—grant them courage, protection, and integrity in every decision. For the local courts throughout the tri-state cities, towns, and villages, may justice be upheld with impartiality and discernment. We lift up the County Governments of Hamilton, Clermont, Boone, Kenton, Campbell, Dearborn, and Ohio counties—guide them in truth, humility, and wise stewardship. As Daniel 2:20–22 declares: "Blessed be the name of God forever and ever, to whom belong wisdom and might.

Help them to embrace their faith deeply and actively support their persecuted brothers and sisters with prayer, advocacy, and generosity. We pray for the transformation of government officials in hostile nations. Soften their hearts and guide them toward truth, justice, and mercy.

He changes times and seasons; he removes kings and sets up kings; he gives wisdom to the wise and knowledge to those who have understanding; he reveals deep and hidden things; he knows what is in the darkness, and the light dwells with him."<br><br></div><br><div class=bg-EmailTODOs><h3><a href="mailto:mark.mcfadden@wslife.com?subject=TODOs"><strong>Email TODO's</strong></a></h3></div><br><div class=bg-TodaysCatechsim><h3><a href=https://todaysreading.github.io/vov/74.html target=_blank>Today's Valley of Vision Prayer</a></h3></div><br><div class=bg-TodaysPsalm><h3>Today's Psalm</h3><strong>Psalm 105</strong>: [1] Oh give thanks to the LORD; call upon his name;
make known his deeds among the peoples!
[2] Sing to him, sing praises to him;
tell of all his wondrous works!
[3] Glory in his holy name;
let the hearts of those who seek the LORD rejoice!
[4] Seek the LORD and his strength;
seek his presence continually!
[5] Remember the wondrous works that he has done,
his miracles, and the judgments he uttered,
[6] O offspring of Abraham, his servant,
children of Jacob, his chosen ones!
[7] He is the LORD our God;
his judgments are in all the earth.
[8] He remembers his covenant forever,
the word that he commanded, for a thousand generations,
[9] the covenant that he made with Abraham,
his sworn promise to Isaac,
[10] which he confirmed to Jacob as a statute,
to Israel as an everlasting covenant,
[11] saying, “To you I will give the land of Canaan
as your portion for an inheritance.”
[12] When they were few in number,
of little account, and sojourners in it,
[13] wandering from nation to nation,
from one kingdom to another people,
[14] he allowed no one to oppress them;
he rebuked kings on their account,
[15] saying, “Touch not my anointed ones,
do my prophets no harm!”
[16] When he summoned a famine on the land
and broke all supply of bread,
[17] he had sent a man ahead of them,
Joseph, who was sold as a slave.
[18] His feet were hurt with fetters;
his neck was put in a collar of iron;
[19] until what he had said came to pass,
the word of the LORD tested him.
[20] The king sent and released him;
the ruler of the peoples set him free;
[21] he made him lord of his house
and ruler of all his possessions,
[22] to bind his princes at his pleasure
and to teach his elders wisdom.
[23] Then Israel came to Egypt;
Jacob sojourned in the land of Ham.
[24] And the LORD made his people very fruitful
and made them stronger than their foes.
[25] He turned their hearts to hate his people,
to deal craftily with his servants.
[26] He sent Moses, his servant,
and Aaron, whom he had chosen.
[27] They performed his signs among them
and miracles in the land of Ham.
[28] He sent darkness, and made the land dark;
they did not rebel against his words.
[29] He turned their waters into blood
and caused their fish to die.
[30] Their land swarmed with frogs,
even in the chambers of their kings.
[31] He spoke, and there came swarms of flies,
and gnats throughout their country.
[32] He gave them hail for rain,
and fiery lightning bolts through their land.
[33] He struck down their vines and fig trees,
and shattered the trees of their country.
[34] He spoke, and the locusts came,
young locusts without number,
[35] which devoured all the vegetation in their land
and ate up the fruit of their ground.
[36] He struck down all the firstborn in their land,
the firstfruits of all their strength.
[37] Then he brought out Israel with silver and gold,
and there was none among his tribes who stumbled.
[38] Egypt was glad when they departed,
for dread of them had fallen upon it.
[39] He spread a cloud for a covering,
and fire to give light by night.
[40] They asked, and he brought quail,
and gave them bread from heaven in abundance.
[41] He opened the rock, and water gushed out;
it flowed through the desert like a river.
[42] For he remembered his holy promise,
and Abraham, his servant.
[43] So he brought his people out with joy,
his chosen ones with singing.
[44] And he gave them the lands of the nations,
and they took possession of the fruit of the peoples’ toil,
[45] that they might keep his statutes
and observe his laws.
