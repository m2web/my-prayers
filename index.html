A Psalm of the Sons of Korah.
[1] LORD, you were favorable to your land;
you restored the fortunes of Jacob.
[2] You forgave the iniquity of your people;
you covered all their sin. Selah
[3] You withdrew all your wrath;
you turned from your hot anger.
[4] Restore us again, O God of our salvation,
and put away your indignation toward us!
[5] Will you be angry with us forever?
Will you prolong your anger to all generations?
[6] Will you not revive us again,
that your people may rejoice in you?
[7] Show us your steadfast love, O LORD,
and grant us your salvation.
[8] Let me hear what God the LORD will speak,
for he will speak peace to his people, to his saints;
but let them not turn back to folly.
[9] Surely his salvation is near to those who fear him,
that glory may dwell in our land.
[10] Steadfast love and faithfulness meet;
righteousness and peace kiss each other.
[11] Faithfulness springs up from the ground,
and righteousness looks down from the sky.
[12] Yes, the LORD will give what is good,
and our land will yield its increase.
[13] Righteousness will go before him
and make his footsteps a way.</div><script>function showSelectedPrayer(e){e!="Select Prayer Category"?$("#selectedPrayer").text(e):$("#selectedPrayer").text("Select a Prayer Category")}Number.prototype.toHHMMSS=function(){var s=parseInt(this,10),e=Math.floor(s/3600),t=Math.floor((s-e*3600)/60),n=s-e*3600-t*60;return e<10&&(e=""+e),t<10&&(t=""+t),n<10&&(n="0"+n),e>0?e+":"+t+":"+n:t+":"+n};var timer=0;function showCount(){timer--,timer>=0&&(document.getElementById("prayerTimer").innerHTML="Time to Pray: "+timer.toHHMMSS(),setTimeout(showCount,1e3))}function startTimer(){var e=document.querySelector('input[name="minutesToPray"]:checked').value;timer=60*e,showCount()}function clearTimer(){timer=0,document.getElementById("prayerTimer").innerHTML="Prayer Time (Minutes)";for(var t=document.getElementsByName("minutesToPray"),e=0;e<t.length;e++)t[e].checked=!1}</script></div></article></div></div></main><footer id=footer class=footer><div class=icon-links><a href=https://todaysprivateprayer.github.io/index.xml rel="noopener alternate" type=application/rss+xml class=iconfont title=rss target=_blank><svg class="icon" viewBox="0 0 1024 1024" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" width="30" height="30"><path d="M819.157333 1024C819.157333 574.592 449.408 204.8.0 204.8V0c561.706667.0 1024 462.293333 1024 1024H819.157333zM140.416 743.04a140.8 140.8.0 01140.501333 140.586667A140.928 140.928.0 01140.074667 1024C62.72 1024 0 961.109333.0 883.626667S62.933333 743.082667 140.416 743.04zM678.784 1024h-199.04c0-263.210667-216.533333-479.786667-479.744-479.786667v-199.04c372.352.0 678.784 306.517333 678.784 678.826667z"/></svg></a></div><div class=copyright><span class=power-by>Powered by <a class=hexo-link href=https://gohugo.io>Hugo</a>
