The Lord is the everlasting God,
the Creator of the ends of the earth.
He does not faint or grow weary;
his understanding is unsearchable.<br><br><strong>2 Corinthians 5:17</strong> - Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation. The old has passed away; behold, the new has come.<br><br><strong>Matthew 11:28-30</strong> - Come to me, all who labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you, and learn from me, for I am gentle and lowly in heart, and you will find rest for your souls. For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light.<br><br><strong>2 Corinthians 12:9</strong> - But he said to me, “My grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness.” Therefore I will boast all the more gladly of my weaknesses, so that the power of Christ may rest upon me.<br><br><strong>1 John 4:7-8</strong> - Beloved, let us love one another, for love is from God, and whoever loves has been born of God and knows God. 8 Anyone who does not love does not know God, because God is love.<br><br><strong>James 1:22</strong> - But be doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving yourselves.<br><br><strong>Philippians 4:6-7</strong> - Do not be anxious about anything, but in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known to God.

 I pray that You would open my eyes, that I may behold wondrous things out of your law (Psalm 119:18). Remove any veil from my heart and mind that prevents me from truly beholding the wondrous things in Your law. Grant me spiritual insight to grasp the depth of Your truth, that I may be amazed and transformed by Your Word. 
 O LORD, I desire to walk in Your truth. Teach me your way, O LORD, that I may walk in your truth; unite my heart to fear your name (Psalm 86:11). Purify my motives and my affections so that my entire being is singularly devoted to fearing Your holy name. May there be no division in my loyalty, but a wholehearted commitment to You alone. 
 Gracious God, I pray that You would satisfy us in the morning with your steadfast love, that we may rejoice and be glad all our days (Psalm 90:14).

For the local courts throughout the tri-state cities, towns, and villages, may justice be upheld with impartiality and discernment. We lift up the County Governments of Hamilton, Clermont, Boone, Kenton, Campbell, Dearborn, and Ohio counties—guide them in truth, humility, and wise stewardship. As Daniel 2:20–22 declares: "Blessed be the name of God forever and ever, to whom belong wisdom and might.

We lift up Oliver, Remi, and Cassidy—for salvation, health, and safety. For Sophya, we pray for her salvation, safety, and well-being at home. For our entire family, we ask for hearts that are motivated to glorify You in everything. Help us all make wise choices in what we listen to and watch. Teach us to turn our fears, needs, and frustrations into faith in the Lord Jesus.<br><br><strong>Individuals</strong>:<br>Josh McFadden and his salvation. Dave Wernz and the efforts at GFC. Caleb Combs neurological condition. Daniel Allison and his marriage to Britney. Rachael Allen healing from cancer; Ben and Rachel Townsend and the blending of their family; Rick & Kim Bular and their daughter and her children as she is now widowed.<br><br><strong>IOUS</strong>:<br>I come before You, confessing my heart's propensity to wander. I pray for Your Spirit to powerfully incline my heart to your testimonies, and not to selfish gain! (Psalm 119:36). Help me to value Your truth above all selfish gain. Turn my eyes from looking at worthless things; and give me life in your ways (Psalm 119:37). Empower me to find true life and joy in Your ways.
I pray that You would open my eyes, that I may behold wondrous things out of your law (Psalm 119:18). Remove any veil from my heart and mind that prevents me from truly beholding the wondrous things in Your law. Grant me spiritual insight to grasp the depth of Your truth, that I may be amazed and transformed by Your Word.
O LORD, I desire to walk in Your truth. Teach me your way, O LORD, that I may walk in your truth; unite my heart to fear your name (Psalm 86:11). Purify my motives and my affections so that my entire being is singularly devoted to fearing Your holy name. May there be no division in my loyalty, but a wholehearted commitment to You alone.
Gracious God, I pray that You would satisfy us in the morning with your steadfast love, that we may rejoice and be glad all our days (Psalm 90:14). Let Your love be the deep well from which I draw all my contentment and joy. May this satisfaction in You empower me to rejoice and be glad in You all my days, regardless of my circumstances.<br><br></div><br><div class=bg-EmailTODOs><h3><a href="mailto:mark.mcfadden@wslife.com?subject=TODOs"><strong>Email TODO's</strong></a></h3></div><br><div class=bg-TodaysCatechsim><h3><a href=https://todaysreading.github.io/vov/50.html target=_blank>Today's Valley of Vision Prayer</a></h3></div><br><div class=bg-TodaysPsalm><h3>Today's Psalm</h3><strong>Psalm 137</strong>: [1] By the waters of Babylon,
there we sat down and wept,
when we remembered Zion.
[2] On the willows there
we hung up our lyres.
[3] For there our captors
required of us songs,
and our tormentors, mirth, saying,
“Sing us one of the songs of Zion!”
[4] How shall we sing the LORD’s song
in a foreign land?
[5] If I forget you, O Jerusalem,
let my right hand forget its skill!
[6] Let my tongue stick to the roof of my mouth,
if I do not remember you,
if I do not set Jerusalem
above my highest joy!
[7] Remember, O LORD, against the Edomites
the day of Jerusalem,
how they said, “Lay it bare, lay it bare,
down to its foundations!”
[8] O daughter of Babylon, doomed to be destroyed,
blessed shall he be who repays you
with what you have done to us!
[9] Blessed shall he be who takes your little ones
and dashes them against the rock!</div><script>function showSelectedPrayer(e){e!="Select Prayer Category"?$("#selectedPrayer").text(e):$("#selectedPrayer").text("Select a Prayer Category")}Number.prototype.toHHMMSS=function(){var s=parseInt(this,10),e=Math.floor(s/3600),t=Math.floor((s-e*3600)/60),n=s-e*3600-t*60;return e<10&&(e=""+e),t<10&&(t=""+t),n<10&&(n="0"+n),e>0?e+":"+t+":"+n:t+":"+n};var timer=0;function showCount(){timer--,timer>=0&&(document.getElementById("prayerTimer").innerHTML="Time to Pray: "+timer.toHHMMSS(),setTimeout(showCount,1e3))}function startTimer(){var e=document.querySelector('input[name="minutesToPray"]:checked').value;timer=60*e,showCount()}function clearTimer(){timer=0,document.getElementById("prayerTimer").innerHTML="Prayer Time (Minutes)";for(var t=document.getElementsByName("minutesToPray"),e=0;e<t.length;e++)t[e].checked=!1}</script></div></article></div></div></main><footer id=footer class=footer><div class=icon-links><a href=https://todaysprivateprayer.github.io/index.xml rel="noopener alternate" type=application/rss+xml class=iconfont title=rss target=_blank><svg class="icon" viewBox="0 0 1024 1024" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" width="30" height="30"><path d="M819.157333 1024C819.157333 574.592 449.408 204.8.0 204.8V0c561.706667.0 1024 462.293333 1024 1024H819.157333zM140.416 743.04a140.8 140.8.0 01140.501333 140.586667A140.928 140.928.0 01140.074667 1024C62.72 1024 0 961.109333.0 883.626667S62.933333 743.082667 140.416 743.04zM678.784 1024h-199.04c0-263.210667-216.533333-479.786667-479.744-479.786667v-199.04c372.352.0 678.784 306.517333 678.784 678.826667z"/></svg></a></div><div class=copyright><span class=power-by>Powered by <a class=hexo-link href=https://gohugo.io>Hugo</a>
