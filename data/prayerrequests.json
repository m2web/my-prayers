Cultivate transparent, grace-filled relationships in our community. Stir in us a deep hunger for the gospel—may it be our daily bread. Help us to live lives that are distinct from the world, marked by holiness, love, and integrity. Fix our eyes on the hope of heaven, and fill us with joy even in hardship. Teach us to give joyfully and generously. Lead us to take the gospel to new places—across the street and around the world. May our work be full of good deeds that reflect Your character and draw others to You. Prepare our hearts for persecution, should it come, and give us boldness and wisdom to share the gospel this week with those You place in our path. Amen.",
