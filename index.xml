[16] But I say, walk by the Spirit, and you will not gratify the desires of the flesh. [17] For the desires of the flesh are against the Spirit, and the desires of the Spirit are against the flesh, for these are opposed to each other, to keep you from doing the things you want to do. Today's Memory Verse 2 Corinthians 5:17 - Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation.</description></item></channel></rss>
